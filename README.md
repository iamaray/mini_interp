# mini_interp

A small interpreter for an extremely simple "toy" programming language. The intepreter -- with its corresponding tokenization, lexing, and parsing -- is fully written in C.

## Toy Language Features

The toy language allows for the following very basic features:

- Variable assignment (int types only)
- While loops
- Basic mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Printing to console
- Comments with `//` syntax
- Comparison operators (`==`, `<=`, `<=`, `<`, `>`)


## To-Do

- [ ] Implement tokenization and dynamic token list.
- [ ] Implement lexer
- [ ] Implment parser
